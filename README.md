# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing daily weather data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The objective is to understand weather patterns such as temperature variation, rainfall distribution, and the relationship between temperature and humidity through meaningful visualizations.

This project was built to strengthen foundational data analysis and visualization skills using Python.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset `weather_data.csv` contains daily weather observations with the following columns:

| Column Name  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Date        | Date of observation |
| Temperature | Daily temperature in °C |
| Rainfall    | Rainfall in mm |
| Humidity    | Humidity percentage |

The dataset covers **30 days of weather data**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## 📈 Visualizations Implemented

- **Line Plot** – Daily temperature trend over time  
- **Bar Chart** – Day-wise rainfall comparison  
- **Histogram** – Temperature distribution  
- **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between temperature and humidity  
- **Pie Chart** – Rainfall category distribution  
- **Subplots Dashboard** – Combined visualization of all plots  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Temperature varies significantly across days.
- Most temperature values fall within a moderate range.
- Rainfall occurs irregularly, with several no-rain days.
- Humidity shows variation with temperature but does not follow a strict linear pattern.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Place `weather_data.csv` and `anala.ipynb` in the same folder  
2. Open `analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
